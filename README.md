## Demo & Snippets

-   N/A

## Requirements / Purpose

-   Outline
An approach to replicate an older iPhone version. Realistic look, but minimal 
functionality. The time will be working and the Weather app will be showing a modal with
the curent weather data for local city of Sydney.

-  MVP
HTML/SCSS
Wallpaper scales to fit the viewport
Minimum 1 icons on desktop
The menu is positioned in the appropriate place (bottom left on windows, top of the screen on android)
"App" looks consistent
Menu contains a flex with content inside it
"App" should use an external API
JavaScript
Put your js code into separate files
Your icons and menu should add event listener for the click event, don't use the html onclick attribute
Give your functions and variables good names
Use the arrow syntax to declare functions
Github
Create a repo on github with a README
Clone Repo
Create and checkout develop branch
Push all changes to your develop branch
When submitting create a pull request from develop into main for review
Add coach as a reviewer
Hints
Split your js logic/data modules from your js DOM modules
Look at the position css property, specifically fixed and absolute
Pay attention to your hierarchy of elements in your html
Create your modals using JS and DOM interaction
Make your life easy! You don't need to recreate everything, just do the features and mvp mentioned above
